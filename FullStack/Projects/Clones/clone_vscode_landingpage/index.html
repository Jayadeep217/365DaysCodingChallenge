                Copilot Chat is an expert on your codebase, helping you to answer questions, explain code, and propose
                fixes. Chat is
                available wherever you need it - either as a dedicated sidebar panel or directly from within your code
                so you can stay
                in context.

                Copilot is your AI pair programmer infused directly into the editor. Just start typing, and Copilot will
                complete your
                thought by offering a completion on the current line or (sometimes) a whole new block of code. Just like
                a coworker, you
                have the flexibility to accept all, some, or none of Copilot's suggestions. Copilot supports a broad
                range of languages
                and frameworks.
