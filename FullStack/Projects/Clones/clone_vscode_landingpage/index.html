Create faster

Describe what you want to build in natural language, and Copilot Edits takes care of the rest. Copilot Edits makes
changes across files in your codebase with a UI designed for rapid iteration. It's the fastest way to add new
functionality to your apps.
Build with Copilot Edits

Copilot Chat is an expert on your codebase, helping you to answer questions, explain code, and propose fixes. Chat is
available wherever you need it - either as a dedicated sidebar panel or directly from within your code so you can stay
in context.

modifications to make each project a link and add dynamic pages. Two files, projects.tsx and [slug].tsx, are in the
working set, with GitHub Copilot suggesting edits.
Code efficiently

Copilot is your AI pair programmer infused directly into the editor. Just start typing, and Copilot will complete your
thought by offering a completion on the current line or (sometimes) a whole new block of code. Just like a coworker, you
have the flexibility to accept all, some, or none of Copilot's suggestions. Copilot supports a broad range of languages
and frameworks.
